# Changelog

## 1.2.0 (in progress) — 2026-08-01

- Added canonical, user-scoped autofill values with validated fixed and custom keys.
- Added encrypted storage helpers so persisted autofill plaintext is never stored directly.
- Added create, read, update, and delete service operations with fail-closed validation and
  user isolation.
- Added the `autofill_values` database migration and an ADR for canonical autofill data and
  declarative automation workflows.
- Verified the autofill increment with Ruff and 112 focused unit tests; application submission
  behavior remains unchanged.

## 1.1.300 — 2026-08-01

- Detailed matching now shares uploaded resume artifacts with the dispatcher and uses the
  internal matching-model service address reliably in Docker Compose.
- Gemini structured outputs are constrained by a compatible JSON Schema subset, preventing
  extraction tasks from returning invalid top-level arrays or mismatched fields.
- Detailed-match polling now treats degraded fallback results as terminal instead of appearing
  to remain pending indefinitely.
- LinkedIn vacancy extraction waits for dynamically rendered semantic content, selects the most
  complete description candidate, and removes Premium promotional blocks before persistence.
- The optional local BGE embedding and reranking service now supports the configured CUDA runtime
  and GPU device exposure through Docker Compose.
- Verified the complete detailed-matching path against running Gemini, OpenSearch, PostgreSQL,
  Redis, and the local embedding service; real application submission behavior remains unchanged.

## 1.1.100 — 2026-07-29

- Search results now appear as soon as each selected source completes instead of
  waiting for every source.
- Partial results remain sorted by match score and are saved while slower sources
  continue searching.
- Search progress shows how many selected sources have completed.

- Personal dashboard with Russian and English interfaces.
- Multiple resume upload, analysis, selection, skill review, and deletion.
- Browser-based hh.ru and LinkedIn search with dashboard-managed sessions.
- Greenhouse public-board search.
- Saved-vacancy catalogue with filters, pagination, match ordering, summaries, salary and work tags.
- Editable, vacancy-language-aware cover letters.

- Optional explainable detailed matching service.
